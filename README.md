# Week3Day2Homework
My home work for week 3 Tuesday.

This was a fun challenge getting my head around interfaces.
I managed to work out what the code did and was able to implement the
necessary changes to get CompareByLength and CompareByName working.

Unfortunately i couldn't work out how to create a test for it so i added
a Square method and a SquareRoot method to the Calculator exercise we
did in class and created AreEqual and AreNotEqual tests for both.
